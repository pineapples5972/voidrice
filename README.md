# My Artix Rice 	

These are the dotfiles deployed by [LARBS](https://larbs.xyz) and as seen on [Luke's YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/lukesmithxyz).

I added some of my custom scripts for my need exclusively.

	- Fireplaces (auto mounting drives in particular location)
	- Myprograms [Mod + D ] ( fetches the dmenu list of programs located in isolated places of hard drives)
	- fibonacchi mode is default in dwm
	- added $FM env variable for File manager and updated in dwm build. (Saves the hassle to recompile it in dwm build)
	- vifm is default here instead of lf
	- added dt's vifmrun script in `~/.local/bin` to get image preview in vifm *successfully*.
        - Other things are similar to luke's version 
```
